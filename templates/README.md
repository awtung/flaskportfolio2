# Welcome to our Website

Here we displayed all of our previous work and are starting to add new tabs that lead to different games

## How to navigate

There is a navigation bar at the top and you can click on them to go to different parts of our site to click on links to our projects. For right now our home button is out of order and we can't figure out how to make it go back to the main. There is a link to a video on the home page explain where we are at on the project


## File Descriptions

### General files

main.py - makes the website urls and it is the base of the website

### Code files

home.html - The main area of our website where we describe where everything is.
flask/games/hello/socials.html - These all are places where links can be found for the specific project that is on the site.
