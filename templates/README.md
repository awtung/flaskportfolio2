# Welcome to our Website

Go to our flask tab to click on the github to our second project which uses Jinja and is the history of games.

Here we displayed all of our previous work and are starting to add new tabs that lead to different games

## How to navigate

There is a navigation bar at the top and you can click on them to go to different parts of our site to click on links to our projects. For right now our home button is out of order and we can't figure out how to make it go back to the main. There is a link on the homepage to our self grades for the week.


## File Descriptions
